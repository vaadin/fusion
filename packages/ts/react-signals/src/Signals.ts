/**

 * shared value on the server.
 *
 * After obtaining the NumberSignal instance from
 * a server-side service that returns one, the value
 * can be updated using the `value` property,
 * and it can be read with or without the
 * `value` property (similar to a normal signal):
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 *  const counter = CounterService.counter();
 *
 * return (
 *    <Button onClick={() => counter++)}>
 *      Click count: { counter }
 *    </Button>
 *    <Button onClick={() => counter.value = 0}>Reset</Button>
 * );
 * ```
